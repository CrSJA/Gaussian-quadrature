# Gaussian cuadrature

The problem to be solve is to aproximate the integral 

$$\int _{0}^{\pi} \sin(x^2) dx$$

Using the Gauusian Cuadrature, this is of particular importace because this integral does not have an analytic solution.

It is also a requaired the creation of a grahp that shows the aproximations on the Y axis and the number of cuts of the aproxiamtion on the x axis
